## Brain Storming

When I go to a party and there's a hired photographer I don't get to see the pictures the photographer took for many days, if ever. The photographer only sends the pictures to the host and usually sends them a few days after the event. This is why people are always taking pretty much the same pictures the photographers took with their phones. People take pictures with their phones because they want to have those pictures available to them instantly. They want to be able to share those pictures on social media instantly. They want to have it on their own device where they have all their familiar apps and tools.

Sometimes I use my own phone and act as the photographer at a small party (someone's home, no professional photographer). In this case the people that know me well are happy to put their phones away and wait for me to share the photos I took because I usually share them (all of them) at the end of the night. But those people that don't know me still break out their own phones.

I'd like to make it possible for a profession photographers to instantly share the pictures they take with the people whose pictures they took. I'm talking within seconds, not the next day, not later than night.

### User Stories

The stories below mention WhatsApp but ideally other mediums of sharing would be made possible as well. For example, SMS/RCS message, iCloud, Google Photos.

- Host: The person/group who hired the photographer

#### Facial Recognition Enabled

A guest arrives and the photographer explains

> I can send you your pictures instantly. Just go here (website), take a picture of your face and give us your WhatsApp number.
> Then we'll use facial recognition to instantly send any photo with your face in it to your WhatsApp number.

#### All Photos Enabled

The host requests that all photos be instantly shared with anyone who gives their WhatsApp number.

### Monetization

#### Free If Allowed To Collect Guest Information
The idea is that we can use the guest information to send them advertisements or sell their data

#### Paid When Guest Information Is Private
To keep guest information private then using the service will incur some cost to the photographer. The photographer is free to pass the cost on to the host or build it into their fee.

## Security Considerations

### Can someone register to get pictures for someone else's face?
